# Tennis-Statistics
Just having some fun with combinatorics and probabilities in Python. We calculate the probability of winning a game, a set or a match for a player given his/her probability to win a point and then visualise the results using Plotly.

If GitHub fails to render the  Jupyter Notebook (due to the interactive Plotly plots) you can check it out via nbviewer [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AndreaDesan/Tennis-Statistics/blob/main/tennisStat.ipynb) or download it and open it locally on your machine.
